This project simulates a basic product catalog system using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It includes:

1. A Product class with properties like name, price, and description.
2. A DiscountedProduct class that extends Product and introduces discount logic.
3. A Store class with a main method to demonstrate functionality.

What You’ll Practice
• Class creation and constructor usage
• Encapsulation using private fields and public getters
• Inheritance with extends
• Method overriding
• Simple calculations with method logic

Your Tasks
• Understand how inheritance is used to reuse and extend features.
• Modify the classes to:
• Add more product attributes if desired.
• Think about how you could test this code with different discount values or product types.
